# Project gRadio
This set of scripts allow you to play GTA San Andreas Radio stations over web

The project is WIP, it is very far from plug and play. Although I have made it work on my setup, the environment needs to be manually configured and it assumes many variables.

Please review the scripts yourself and ensure that it works with your particular configuration.

Further development and documentation to be expected

I used San Andreas Audio Toolkit GUI version to extract the audio files from the game. GUI is closed source, but the source code for CLI tool is included. Use at your disgression.
